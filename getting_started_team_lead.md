## What to expect from the campaign

The campaign team provides input on key issues or events that are important to highlight in an email campaign. A campaign may have specific messaging for key issues (e.g., healthcare), so they may be more involved with content development on those issues. The campaign team also reviews and approves all emails before they are sent.

Campaign action items:

- Provide the email list
- Provide assets used in emails such as photography
- Provide email platform access
- Provide access to ActBlue, Mobilize, and other 3rd party systems that need tracking metrics applied
- Propose general content / issues, key events and high-level messaging for the email campaign
- Approve emails

## Tools You&#39;ll (Likely) Be Using

- Slack/email for team communication
- Slab - where all our documentation lives. You&#39;re already here, yay!
- [NGP](https://techforcampaigns.slab.com/topics/3-6-ngp-xrr115n3) - for sending emails, campaign will need to grant access.
- [Actblue](https://techforcampaigns.slab.com/posts/act-blue-landing-pages-mxc8a9bc) - landing pages where people donate, campaign will need to grant access.

## Project Planning and Reporting Templates (Make copies of these templates in your team&#39;s Google Drive)

- [**Weekly Roadmap**](https://techforcampaigns.slab.com/posts/weekly-roadmap-email-projects-wecin90n)**:** This covers all the tasks that each team member should complete each week of the project. 
- [**Email Project Template**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10NrvZzVkUPXO2Fy77_oo5eRuF9nWG1AGuGckL1UeAEg/copy)**:** This is what your team will use to plan email content for the entirety of your project, stay up to date on the status of email drafting/sending/approvals, and most importantly, track email performance. Team Lead is responsible for content calendar, data analyst is responsible for updating email performance 72 hours after each email is sent. 
- [Email Lifecycle](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dah-cEAMNug7kUNbFK_dQl9lBemkVo19sghk1Ecutrw/copy): This lists every task that goes into putting together a single email — so you know who’s responsible for what and by when.
- [Email Drafts doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XACdtrm4d4T6NWTOqzSYSGgphJ3RPP0s2UrWV_w2EnQ/copy): This document should be used for the development and review of each email. They should be stored on the Google Drive and links to review should be shared. This ensures drafts and edits live in one location.

Also, a best practice is to create a folder inside your team&#39;s Google Drive Folder for the campaign to use to upload relevant creative and assets. (Note: If the campaign is already housing their assets somewhere, they may opt to give the team permission to access that site. In that case you would not need this folder.)
