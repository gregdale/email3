# TFC September 3, 2020 Memo to Teams

Posted: Sept 3, 2020 (Updated: Sept 28, 2020)

To All TFC Project Teams:

Early this morning, ​[Facebook announced a new policy](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/additional-steps-to-protect-the-us-elections/)​ limiting some political advertising in the week before the election as part of their ongoing attempt to combat election interference and misinformation online. We want to make sure you’re aware of what the changes actually mean and also explain how you and your TFC team will need to modify things starting today.

## **Key points to understand regarding the 09/03/20 Announcement:**

- Advertisers will not be able to create new ads about social issues, elections or politics in the US between October 27 and November 3.
- Ads about social issues, election or politics in the US that are **approved and delivering** impressions prior to Oct 27 will be allowed to continue through Nov 3.
- Between Oct 27 and Nov 3, we will not be able to edit creative (including image/video assets, destination and text), placement or optimization.
- We will be able to update targeting, budget and bids for these ads on or after Oct 27.

## **Digital Ads Teams**

- **October 20 Deadline**: All 2020 ads must be submitted by end of day, October 20th, seven days before the Facebook ad freeze. Make sure all of your Facebook GOTV Campaigns, Ad Sets, and audiences are approved and running with approved ads. This will give time to correct anything that is rejected.
- **Media Budgets**: There is no guarantee that Facebook will be able to spend additional money on existing ads, especially in small districts. Any campaign that anticipates ad budget increases should start spending more money at least 2 weeks before the freeze. 
- **Campaign Communication:** In your next campaign call, please explain the changes to your campaigns, explain the 20th deadline and approvals needed and reinforce with your campaigns that we cannot change or launch ads after the freeze. 

**For All Teams**

- Use this opportunity to drive fundraising today. “Facebook is freezing ads at the end of October, that means dollars after late October won’t help us with ads. So, chip in $$ for ads today so we can ensure we can reach everyone we need to for the win!”
- Plan ahead - 100% of your creative and ad submission through the election will need to be submitted.
- Email and Text teams should anticipate the need for extra communication in the last week of the cycle. It may not be required, but plan for flexibility.
- **Facebook will:** 
    - add a link to their Voting Information Center at the top of Facebook and Instagram almost every day until Election Day
    - proactively remove posts linking COVID-19 to voting 
    - attach informational labels to content that discusses voting (example below)

The Tech for Campaigns team is prepared to guide you through these changes, and any additional changes throughout the 2020 election cycle.

Please reach out to your State Director with any questions.
